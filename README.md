# Web Interface

## Editors and Broadcasters

A broadcaster can add multiple editors who then can manage the rewards.
This is done in the `Editors`-tab.

**Important:** A broadcaster can **only** add editors that have registered on this app (like on BTTV).

The editors can access the rewards through the `Broadcasters` tab.

## Rewards

You can edit the rewards in the `Rewards` tab.

When adding or editing a reward, you can change the action at the bottom.
Click on the pen (‚úè) icon to select the reward.

First, you can edit Twitch specific parameters like the reward title or the cooldown.
The cooldown can be specified like this: `1h`, `3.5d`, `3m` or `123` (seconds).

Some rewards expose a `Duration` configuration.
Here, you can specify the duration like this: `1hour 3min 4ms`.
For more examples go [here](https://docs.rs/humantime/2.1.0/humantime/fn.parse_duration.html).

You can also provide the duration like this: `rand( 10m ; 10h )`.
This would timeout the user for a random duration between `10m` and `1h`.

### Available Rewards

- Enter Subonly-mode (constant or random duration)
- Enter Emoteonly-mode (constant or random duration)

# Development

## Setup

- Setup a [`postgres`](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
- Create a new application on the [Twitch Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).
- Copy `config.toml.example` to `config.toml` and set the appropriate values.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the `DATABASE_URL` to the one you configured.
- Run `setup.sh` or `setup.bat` depending on your platform.
- Setup nginx to proxy `8082`.
- Add the following entry to your nginx config:

```conf
location /api/v1/metrics {
    return 403;
}
```

- Add the following job to your prometheus config

```yaml
- job_name: 'rewards'
  scrape_interval: 10s
  metrics_path: '/api/v1/metrics'
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:8082']
```

- Now you're done!

### Setting up a development environment

- Use [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) to create a tunnel to your machine for _eventsub_.
- Edit `server.url` to the ngrok-https-url.
- In the `web` directory set the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the ngrok-https-url.

## Roadmap

Things to-do are tracked [here](https://github.com/Nerixyz/rewards/projects).

# Internal - web API

All endpoints are on `/api/v1`. All endpoints (except `/auth/twich-auth-url` and the auth-callbacks) require authentication.

Authentication is done through the `Authorization` header
that has to be set to `Bearer { cookie(auth_token) }`.
